<h1> LIRI Bot </h1>
<h3>UCB-2019 Class Assignment</h3>
<p>
    In this assignment, we'll make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
